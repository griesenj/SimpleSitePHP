# Simple PHP Website

This project was created as a part of a graduate level computer science class with focus on HTML, PHP, and SQLite. Basic backend functionality through PHP was used for web forms and generation of a dynamic HTML table. Read/write operations acted on a text file rather than a formal database based on server-side limitations associated with SQLite. Additionally, this project restricted all use of JavaScript.
