		<h1>How to Play</h1>

		<h2>Overview</h2>

 		<p>
		Disc golf is a growing sport that combines several aspects of frisbee and traditional ball golf. The basic premise is 
		to get your disc into the basket at the end of a given hole in the fewest number of throws (strokes).
		</p>

		<hr ckass="rounded">

		<h2>Disc Types</h2>
		<h3>Driver</h3>
		<p>
		The driver is generally the heaviest and most aerodynamic type of disc. The primary giveaways of this type of disc are
		their dense feel and comparatively "sharp" outer edge. Designed to be thrown at higher speeds, the ultimate goal of the
		driver is to get as close to the basket as possible when throwing off of the tee.
		</p>

		<h3>Midrange</h3>
		<p>
		The mid-range disc is a nice blend of the attributes favored by the driver and the putter. While a seasoned player will
		likely be able to throw a mid-range disc an impressive distance, these discs generally offer considerably greater accuracy
		when compared to drivers. Their increased stability and smooth feel make them a perfect option for approach shots, and they
		can even be used off of the tee on shorter holes.
		</p>

		<h3>Putter</h3>
		<p>
		The putter is the closest type of disc to a traditional frisbee. They have a wide outer edge and can be controlled very well
		at shorter distances by virtue of their straight flight paths. These are the generally the discs of choice for close range shots,
		as their wide edges are most easily caught by the chains of the basket.
		</p>

		<h2>Stability</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Stable</b> - A disc that tends to fly in a straight line for the majority of its flight.
			<li><b>Understable</b> - A disc that tends to turn to the right when thrown at high speeds (RHBH throw).
			<li><b>Overstable</b> - A disc that tends to turn to the left when thrown at high speeds (RHBH throw).
		</ul>

		<p>
		<b><i>NOTE: As a general rule of thumb, overstable discs are not very beginner friendly. They need to be thrown very hard to
		 behave as desired.</i></b>
		</p>

		<h2>Release Angle</h2>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Hyzer</b> - When throwing a hyzer, the top of the disc will face <u><b>away</b></u> from the player on release.
		<li><b>Anhyzer</b> - When throwing a anhyzer, the top of the disc will face <u><b>towards</b></u> the player on release.
		</ul>

		<hr ckass="rounded">

		<h2>Types of Throws</h2>
		<h3>Standard</h3>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Righthanded Backhand (RHBH)</b> - The disc rotates clockwise and wants to fade to the left.
			<li><b>Righthanded Forehand (RHFH)</b> - The disc rotates counterclockwise and wants to fade to the right.
			<li><b>Lefthanded Backhand (LHBH)</b> - The disc rotates counterclockwise and wants to fade to the right.
			<li><b>Lefthanded Forehand (LHFH)</b> - The disc rotates clockwise and wants to fade to the left.
		</ul>

		<h3>Variations</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Spike Hyzer</b> - The disc is thrown with an extreme hyzer angle, landing vertically and quickly stopping after attaining great height.
			<li><b>Roller</b> - The disc is thrown with an extreme anhyzer angle, landing verically and rolling for long distances.
			<li><b>Tomahawk</b> - The disc is thrown vertically with an overhanded motion (similar to throwing a baseball).
		</ul>
